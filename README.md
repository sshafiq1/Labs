Labs for Intro to VGD

Lab 1:
I created a main scene with a black kitten and an orange kitten as the two sprites. I created multiple instances of a nested scene. The nested scene is a hay stack and the kittens are playing in a barn. 
Creating the different scenes was confusing at first, but easy to adapt to. My question is why do we have our root node be our first sprite? Is that how we normally do things or are there cases were we would want our root node to be something specific?

Lab 2: Help the kitten catch the mice.
